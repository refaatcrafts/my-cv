## Crafting the perfect cover letter

Your cover letter serves as a handshake, an introduction to the professional persona encapsulated in your resume. It's an avenue to express your genuine interest in a position or a particular company, portraying the value you can add to the organization. Unlike the formal tone of a resume, a cover letter allows for a unique, creative expression of your personal brand, ensuring it **complements rather than replicates** your resume.

**Tailoring is key in crafting a compelling cover letter. **It is about aligning your skills and aspirations with the role at hand, going beyond mere name switches. Hence, delve into the company's ethos, the industry, and the specific role, letting your cover letter reflect a clear understanding and a deliberate choice. You need to show that you have done your research and you understand the company mission and how you will contribute towards that goal.

The cover letter should **highlight the resume, rather than duplicate the content** (which is what is seen too often). In some cases, the cover letter will be the first document, and sometimes, the only document an employer or recruiter sees, and as such, should make a stellar first impression.

:::

Here's a structure to transform your cover letter into a compelling narrative:

- Capture Attention: In your opening paragraph, succinctly present the primary reasons you are an ideal candidate for the job.
- Express Your Value: Highlight **what you bring to the table**, how you can contribute to the company's goals.
- Narrate Succinctly: People resonate with stories. Share a **brief, relevant narrative** that leaves the reader intrigued. Similar to your resume, you should very rarely go beyond the one page limit.

### Common pitfalls to avoid on your cover letter

- The Generic Trap: **Tailor your cover letter** to the job and company. Avoid a one-size-fits-all approach.
- Repetition: Your cover letter should **accentuate your resume, not echo it.**
- Over-verbosity: Keep it crisp, to the point, and **under a page.**
- Sloppiness: Errors in spelling or grammar reflect poorly on your attention to detail. Proofread meticulously.

### Practical tips

- Align your qualifications with the employer's needs.
- Keep it engaging. Avoid cliches and standard phrases. Your first paragraph should capture the attention of the employer.
- Ensure your cover letter is free from errors. Enlist a friend to review it or put it aside and review with fresh eyes later.

### Cover letter example and evaluation

Example of an ML Engineer Cover Letter:

1. _Paragraph 1: The Hook and personal touch_ <br></br>

> Growing up in Argentina, questions about economics are part of everyday life long before you become an Economics student. While many developing countries suffer the consequences of natural disasters or geopolitical conflicts, most - generations of Argentines have spent their entire lives avoiding the consequences of the crisis caused by macroeconomic imbalances in our country. Possibly due to this history, it is practically impossible to spend a day of your life without listening to a friend or family member make predictions about what the exchange rate between the peso and the dollar should be, or their opinion about what should be done by the Central Bank to lower inflation.

<br></br>

2. _Paragraph 2: Motivation, background and growth story_ <br></br>

> Curiosity to find an answer to these daily questions was what motivated me to start my Degree in Economics at the University of Buenos Aires. I did my entire university career while working at the [BANK], experience that was exhausting and challenging in similar proportions. During my eight years working in a financial institution, I have seen first-hand how new technologies and Big Data tools have been transforming the way in which corporate decisions are made. That aroused my curiosity in the different Machine Learning techniques and for that reason I moved to Madrid to perform my Master in Big Data. After that, I was approached by a recruiter that gave me the opportunity to unleash my skills in the gaming industry in London.

3. _Paragraph 3: Showcase achievements, impact and stakeholder management_ <br></br>

> [GAMING COMPANY] gave me an incredible opportunity. For the first time in my career, I was able to connect my childhood memories as a gamer with my professional skills. The capable leadership at [GAMING COMPANY] quickly identified my project management and analytical skills and they gave me huge responsibilities. I worked closely with the Chief Strategy Officer and the Head of External Developer Relations to identify potential publishing and M&A opportunities. During my watch we closed two strategic deals that are now contributing with more than 10% of the portfolio revenue. After that incredible experience, I was invited to join a start-smaller SaaS mobile data company called [SAAS COMPANY]. It was a hard decision but the challenge of joining a start-up and helping they grow and expand globally was an opportunity that I could not decline.

4. _Paragraph 4: Motivation to join the company aligned with personal values_ <br></br>

> After [SAAS COMPANY] I had the opportunity to apply my skills in the Fintech industry. Coming from Argentina, where the population suffer the consequences of the absence of good credit, I was extremely excited about [BNLP FINTECH]’s mission of democratizing free-credit in the UK and the U.S.

## Final tips

### Do not take job application forms lightly

If the company you are applying for requires you to fill in the "Work Experience" and "Education" sections into their own form, do not take it lightly! Most of the time, these are internal HR applications which help parse job applications and filter out candidates from the information provided. In fact, it is possible that your resume is never seen by the recruiter or hiring manager - only the information that you fill up in their forms!

### Do not apply to many jobs at the same company

The ATS also allows recruiters to see all the roles you have applied to at their company. Try not to apply to too many jobs as a recruiter wouldn't be able to tell if you're actually interested in or if you're self-aware about your abilities. E.g. applying for a Software Engineer and a Data Scientist role at the same company is not a good idea.

## About me

Hi, I am Hassan Refaat, a very passionate software engineer. I love building and crafting software solutions. I am a **product-minded engineer** who really loves building software that has a big impact on the user and the product. I love to solve **user struggles** and build software to help them. I am always very passionate about taking initiatives, finding solutions, building them as an MVP, and tracking the impact of those solutions.

I am good at using **AI tools effectively** to accelerate software development and build effective solutions. I also have a strong background in AI engineering and how to build AI solutions that support the domain or product I am working on.

I am a self-driven person. I know how to grow and I understand what things need to be done in the work to be successful.

### Tech Stack

* **Backend:** Mainly Spring Boot and JVM languages like Java and Kotlin. I also work with Golang.
* **Database:** Deep knowledge of PostgreSQL (query optimization) and MongoDB.
* **AI:** Building AI agents using Spring AI, LLMs, and RAG.
* **DevOps & Cloud:** Knowledge of building CI/CDs using GCP and AWS.
* **Observability:** Passionate about using Datadog and Grafana.

## My work at Taager

During my work at Taager, I achieved the following:

1. **Built and integrated connectors** with WooCommerce and Lightfunnels, driving **300K+ additional orders** in Taager’s opted-in markets.
2. **Led a major initiative** to build a full working store builder (like Shopify) from scratch to support our merchants and give them a better experience. I took this initiative from the ground up, building a full working MVP using the **Spring ecosystem**. I handled the frontend using Next.js and React by using **AI agents**, which led to a better experience for our merchants. This project now handles around **100 orders daily**, and I led a team of 3 developers to make this a success.
3. **Optimized order confirmation messages** by including merchant store information and collaborating with the product team to redesign the confirmation flow. This improvement increased the order confirmation rate by **2%**.
4. **Acted as a technical partner** for high-value and internal merchants, unblocking critical issues and supporting onboarding. I led technical support and alignment sessions when no engineering owner was available, guided merchants migrating from other platforms, and built **custom scripts and internal tooling** (e.g., bulk product publishing). This work improved merchant satisfaction, retention, and activation.
5. **Refactored internal merchant and store services** to improve communication, leading to a **15% reduction in latency**, optimized logging (saving **$500/month**), and resolved critical incidents. I also led a migration of our old system that was heavily used by our top merchants, allowing us to shut down 3 legacy services, which reduced infrastructure costs and improved the developer experience.

## Side Project: Yadwy

**Yadwy** is a handmade marketplace and multi-seller platform. I handled everything from market research and collecting ideas by talking with sellers to leading the product discovery.

* **Engineering:** I led the technical side, building the backend with a **modular monolithic architecture** using the Spring stack and PostgreSQL.
* **Frontend:** I built the frontend using **AI coding agents** with React and TypeScript.
* **Infrastructure:** I self-hosted all the necessary infrastructure using a **Docker stack**, and used Cloudflare R2 (S3 compatible) for media storage.
* **Result:** Yadwy is now a fully functional marketplace for customers and a multi-seller platform where sellers can create and see their orders, including integrations with shipping companies.
